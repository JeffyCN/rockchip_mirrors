	help
	  The "sync" option may not be a good choice to use with flash
	  drives, as it forces a greater amount of writing operating on
	  the drive. This makes the writing speed considerably lower
	  and also leads to a faster wear out of the disk.

	  If you omit it, don't forget to use the command "sync" to
	  synchronize the data on your disk before removing the drive
	  or you may experience data loss.
